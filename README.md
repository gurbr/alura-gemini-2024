## ✨ **About the Project**
This project was developed during the "Imersão Alura com Google Gemini" in the first week of September 2024 as the very first steps of my learning journey in web development. My passion for Liverpool FC served as the inspiration for creating my first project.

## 🙏 **Gratitude**
I want to give a huge shoutout to **Alura** and **Google** for this amazing learning opportunity. It was my very first time diving into web development and programming. What seemed impossible to learn before, after the 5-day immersion, became my new passion, and I'm seriously considering a career in front-end development. A very special thanks to **Guilherme Lima**, **Luciano Martins**, and **Rafaella Ballerini** for being such awesome instructors. Your teaching is spot on! You guys are incredibly inspiring professionals. I hope to join your ranks as a fellow developer soon!
